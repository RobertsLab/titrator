## 1. DAILY STARTUP PROCEDURES

#### Check Reagents
1. Check the volume of DI water in the rinse bottle. You need at least 300mL to process a full carousel of samples.
2. Check the hose in the rinse bottle to ensure it reaches the bottom of the bottle.
3. Check the volume of HCl in the amber bottle. You will need at least 50mL to process a single sample (30mL for initial purging procedure and ~5mL for each subsequent sample).

*__IMPORTANT__*: If the volume of HCl is below the halfway mark, please submit a purchase request for more acid, as there is significant lead time for receiving new orders of HCl.

#### Start LabX Software, Titrator, and Rondolino
1. Login in to the your user account on the computer next to the titrator and open LabX.
2. Turn the titrator on (button on front of cube).
3. Turn the Rondolino on (switch on rear, lower right). It will perform a brief system check, where the probes will raise and the carousel will rotate, before returning the probes and carousel to their original positions.
4. Ensure the right blue dial on top of the Rondolino is turned to position 1. This enables the probe-rinsing feature.
4. Press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino (rotates carousel 180˚)
5. Place an empty cup in position zero.
6. Press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino to turn carousel 180˚ back to position zero.

#### Calibrate the pH Meter

1. Place each buffer in cups and place the cups in positions 1 (pH 7.0), 2 (pH 4.0), and 3 (pH 10.0) of the sample changer.

    - *__The order of the buffers is critical!__*

2. CAREFULLY open the small gray cap on the pH probe, add KCl if needed; the liquid inside the pH probe should be within or above the frosted glass portion.
3. Insert the probe behind the Temperature Sensor and either across from, or in front of the acid line
     The stirrer stirs clockwise, so in order to get accurate readings, the acid line should not be directly behind the pH probe
4. On the LabX main page, click on analysis (bottom left of the screen), select the calibration method (pH Cal), click on the green start button at the top of the screen
5. On the LABX main page, top left - click on the Work Bench to see the sample being measured
6. FOR THE BUFFERS a variation between 0 and 0.3 is acceptable. If it is greater than that, use newer buffers and repeat the calibration process
7. When the calibration is completed, on the LABX mainscreen, open the DATA and click on MY LATEST RESULTS
8. In the results details section you will have the values for the slope and zero point, record this on the logging sheet
9. In the measured values section you will have the results pH 4.01, 7.00, 9.21 record these values on the logging sheet
10. Record the temperature of the buffers measured during the calibration
11. Refer to the calculation and recording data section before going any further

## Calculation and recording pH probe caliration data



## 3. Measuring the CRM (CO2 Reference Materials) sample

#### Purge Acid Line

1. On the touchscreen of the titrator, press ```PURGE 3x```, press ```START```.
2. After the purging cycle, press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino to turn carousel 180˚and remove the acid cup.
3. Discard the acid in the hazardous waste jug.
4. Rinse the acid cup with DI water and leave inverted on drying rack above sink.
5. Add 60mL of fresh DI water to the DI cup and place in position zero.
6. Press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino to rotate carousel 180˚ back to position zero.

## Measuring the CRM (CO2 Reference Materials) sample



Rondolino:

*pH Probe Storage Procedures:*
- Temporary (No longer than a week) - can stay in the Rondolino in pH 4.0 Buffer
- Medium-term (No longer than a month) - move to the pH probe holder on the titrator, close gray cap
- Long-term (Longer than a month) - move to the pH probe holder on the titrator and place clear cap over the end containing KCl, close gray cap
